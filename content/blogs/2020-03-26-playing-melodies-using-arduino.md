title: Playing Melodies Using Arduino

## **Introduction**

Today we are going to tinker something easy and simple but interesting. We will be exploring something musical by taking advantage of microcontrollers capability to produce voltage signals. Our goal is to produce a melody using and Arduino Uno and a speaker.

The theory behind this is by generating a square wave signal and controlling its duration, we are essentially varying the voltage supplied to the speaker. With this we are going to use the Arduino Tone function.

As per Arduino Tone function documentation, a single pin can produce a frequency around  
31Hz to 65,535 kHz. According to our scientist humans can hear frequency from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz but we hear best on frequency from 1,000 Hz to 5,000 Hz. This is human speaking frequency.

As a caveat, I am not a musician or a musically inclined person so please pardon my limitations with regards to music especially with this tinkering. üôÇ

## **Bill Of Materials**  

1. Arduino Uno microcontroller.  
2. A speaker (we are not going to use any audio amplifier to simplify our circuits, but please feel free to use one).

## **Hardware Instruction**  

1. Connect the +pin of the speaker to Arduino Uno pin 9.  
2. Connect the other pin of the speaker to Arduino GND pin.  
3. Connect the Arduino Uno board to computer.  
4. Select ‚ÄúArduino Uno‚Äù under Tools &gt; Board.  
5. Make sure that the correct serial port is selected under Tools &gt; Port.  
6. Upload the sketch using the source code provided.  
7. Enjoy.

    // to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.

## **Call To Action**

Please feel free to modify the source code to your liking. You may try to imitate your favorite melodies by changing the melody array and its respective noteDuration arrays.
