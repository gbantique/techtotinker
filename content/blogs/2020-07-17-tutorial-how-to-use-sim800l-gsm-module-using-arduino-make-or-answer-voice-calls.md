## **Introduction**

Here we will further our exploration with the SIM800L GSM Module by testing the voice call capability.

**To make a voice call:**  
 1. Send **ATD+ZZxxxxxxxxxx;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;**  
 – this is tell the GSM module to dial the following mobile number  
 **ZZ** – the country code of the mobile number you want to call  
 **xx** – is the 10-digit mobile number  
 **;** – don’t forget semi-colon, it will error without the semi-colon  
 **CR** – Cariage Return, ASCII character 13 or r  
 **LF** – Line Feed, ASCII character 10 or n  
   
**To answer the incoming voice call:**  
 1. Send **ATA&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;**  
 – this tells the GSM module to answer the incoming voice call  
 **CR** – Cariage Return, ASCII character 13 or r  
 **LF** – Line Feed, ASCII character 10 or n

**To reject the incoming call or terminate ongoing call:**  
 1. Send **ATH&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;**  
 – this tells the GSM module to hang up the call.  
 **CR** – Cariage Return, ASCII character 13 or r  
 **LF** – Line Feed, ASCII character 10 or n

## **Video Demonstration**

## **Source Code**

```cpp { lineNos="true" wrap="true" }
#include "SoftwareSerial.h"

SoftwareSerial mySerial(2, 3);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  mySerial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(){
  while (Serial.available()) 
  {
    mySerial.write(Serial.read());//Forward what Serial received to Software Serial Port
  }
  while(mySerial.available()) 
  {
    Serial.write(mySerial.read());//Forward what Software Serial received to Serial Port
  }
}
```
