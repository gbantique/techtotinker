## **Introduction**

I am fascinated how easy it is to build an mp3 player using a DF Player Mini. DF Player mini is a cheap mp3 player.

## **Bill Of Materials**

1. DF Player mini  
2. Breadboard  
3. Battery / power supply  
4. Speaker  
5. A couple of jumper wires  
6. A micro SD card with some mp3 files loaded.

## **Hardware Instruction**

1. Insert the micro SD card to the DF player mini.  
2. Place the DF player mini to the breadboard.  
3. Connect power supply +5V to VCC pin (pin 1, please refer to below picture)  
4. Connect power supply ground to GND pin (pin 7).  
5. Connect the speaker â€“ pin to SPK\_1 (pin 6) and speaker + pin to SPK\_2 pins (pin 8).  
6. Connect a jumper wire to GND pin (pin 10)

## **Basic Operation**

So basically, IO\_1 and IO\_2 is used as follows:  
1. short press IO\_1: play previous  
2. long press IO\_1: volume down  
3. short press IO\_2: play next  
4. long press IO\_2: volume up
