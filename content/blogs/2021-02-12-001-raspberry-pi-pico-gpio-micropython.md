## **Introduction**

![](/images/001-pico-binary-coded-decimal-micropython.png)

In this article, I would like to share to you the results of my exploration with the basic GPIO of the Raspberry Pi Pico using the MicroPython language.

## **Bill Of Materials**

1. Raspberry Pi Pico dev board.
2. Breadboard.
3. 5 pieces of LEDs with its appropriate limiting resistor.
4. 3 pieces of tactile switch.
5. and some jumper wires.

## **Hardware Instruction**

1. First, attach the Raspberry Pi Pico development board to the breadboard and make sure to refer to the circuit diagram below.
2. Next, setup all the LEDs so that its anode pin(long leg) is connected to the limiting resistor in order to prevent damaging the LEDs from over current while its cathode pin to the ground.
3. Next, connect the first LED (red LED in my case) to GPIO 2 (pin 4) of the RPi Pico.
4. Next, connect the second LED (green LED in my case) to GPIO 3 (pin 5) of the RPi Pico.
5. Next, connect the third LED (blue LED in my case) to GPIO 4 (pin 6) of the RPi Pico.
6. Next, connect the fourth LED (yellow LED in my case) to GPIO 5 (pin 7) of the RPi Pico.
7. Next, connect the fifth LED (white LED in my case) to GPIO 6 (pin 9) of the RPi Pico.
8. Next, setup all the tactile switch so that one side of the switch is connected to the ground.
9. Next, connect the first button to GPIO 11 (pin15) of the RPi Pico.
10. Next, connect the second button to GPIO 12 (pin 16) of the RPi Pico.
11. Next, connect the third button to GPIO 13 (pin 17) of the RPi Pico.
12. Lastly, make sure to connect the ground pin of RPi Pico to the ground rail. Our demo circuit should now be ready.

### 1. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) using LEDs:

*This code aims to display a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) using LEDs. BCD value can be decremented using the first button (swA) or incremented using the third button (swC). The BCD value can be reset using the middle button (swB).*
