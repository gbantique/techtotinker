## **Instruction**

In my desire to tinker with the SD card, I come up with a plan to create a mini karaoke player using Arduino microcontroller, Keypad and LCD shield as keypad and display, and SD card as data source of sound and lyrics files.

Two weeks ago, I am able to play wav files from SD card to a speaker (please see: [Part 1: Wav Music Player Using Arduino Uno and SD Card](https://tech-to-tinker.blogspot.com/2020/04/wav-music-player-using-arduino-uno-and.html)). Last night, I am finally able to sync the LRC lyrics file with the currently playing wav files.
